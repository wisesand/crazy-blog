# Crazy Blog

This is simple blog website . I created this when I was learning React . The project is inspired by [The Net Ninza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d) Youtube Channel. You may find it helpful if you are beginner for React.

# Steps to run the code

## essential setup

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed

2. Install the json server to fetch data from a server

```shell
npm install -g json-server
```

3. Clone the project to your local machine

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wisesand/crazy-blog.git
```

4. Go to the project directory and run

```shell
npm install
```

5. Start the development server

```shell
npm start
```

6. Watch the local json server by running the following

```shell
json-server --watch db.json --port 4040
```

Ps: I have added custom 404 pages, hope you will like it.
